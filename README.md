# umbridge_tng
Code from my master thesis 'Efficient Bayesian Inference for Cosmological Simulations - A Feasibility Study'

Some of the code is based on tinyDA example scripts written by Mikkel Lykkegaard that it publicly available at
https://github.com/mikkelbue/tinyDA/tree/main/examples

Large parts of allocation_queue.sh and job.sh were written by Linus Seelinger, and reformulated by me to suit the specific problem.
The UM-Bridge code can be found in the repository
